# sublime-text
A place to store my sublime text setup.

To install:

1. Put the following files in ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User
    * Default (OSX).sublime-keymap
    * Default.sublime-mousemap

NOTE: I tried messing with symlinks, but couldn't get it to work after 15 minutes of trying. Something like that would be ideal, but I don't change my Sublime Text preferences very often.
